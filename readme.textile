h1. WebcamInput

WebcamInput is a script that replaces <input type="file"> with a webcam field.

It uses javascript to toggle the file/webcam mode and Flash to take the picture from your webcam.

This could be used in your register page, to take a quick picture of your user to use as an avatar.


h2. Using

Just copy and paste the example HTML and change to suite your needs. Flash source is included if you want to custom it.

There is a sample PHP script to upload the file if your are using the regular file input, or base64_decode if you are using WebcamInput. If you have any problem adapting this to your project, contact the author.

h2. Contributing

Just fork this project on github and send me a pull request.
